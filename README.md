# Hi there! 👋 I'm Aslam

**Web Developer from Aceh, Indonesia** 🇮🇩

I'm passionate about building web applications that actually solve real-world problems. Currently working on healthcare systems that help hospitals run more efficiently - because good code can literally save lives! 🏥

## 🔭 What I'm working on
- Maintaining and improving Hospital Information Systems (SIMRS)
- Building APIs that connect healthcare providers with government services
- Always looking for ways to optimize database performance (those patient records add up fast!)

## 🛠️ My toolbox
```php
<?php
// My daily drivers
$skills = [
    'backend' => ['PHP', 'Laravel', 'MySQL', 'PostgreSQL', 'Milvus', 'Generative AI'],
    'frontend' => ['Bootstrap', 'HTML/CSS', 'JavaScript'],
    'api' => ['REST API', 'JWT', 'OAuth'],
    'tools' => ['Git', 'Chrome DevTools', 'Queue Systems']
];
```

## 🌱 Currently learning
Always trying to stay updated with the latest Laravel features and exploring Node.js, Go, & Python to expand my backend toolkit.

## 💡 Fun facts about me
- 🐛 I once spent 3 days debugging a "mysterious" performance issue... turned out to be missing database indexes (classic!)
- 📱 I've integrated with BPJS (Indonesia's healthcare system) more times than I can count
- 🎯 I believe the best code is code that works reliably at 3 AM when the hospital needs it most
- ☕ Fueled by kopi Aceh and the satisfaction of solving complex integration problems

## 🤝 Let's collaborate!
I'm always interested in:
- Healthcare technology projects
- Open source contributions that benefit Indonesian developers
- Sharing knowledge about Laravel best practices
- Projects that make a positive impact on communities
